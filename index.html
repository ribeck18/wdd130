            <p>My name is Riley Beck, and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at BYU Idaho. I am currently taking a web development class to fulfill requirements for my major. So far, I have found it very intriguing and would be interested in exploring the topic further. </p>
            <p>I was raised in Idaho and have taken full advantage of the outdoor adventures in the surrounding area. I love to ride dirt bikes and snowmachines with my dad and brothers, and I’m always up for a cross-country Harley ride! </p>
            <p>	In the future, I would love to continue pursuing computer science, and it would be a dream come true to work on motorcycles on the side! </p>
